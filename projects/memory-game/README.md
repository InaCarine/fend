## Introduction
This memory game is one of the projects that I completed during the Google Front-end developer Nanodegree scholarship.  
It should fulfill all the requirements outlined in the [project rubics](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view).

## How to play
The game goes out on that all the cards are laid face down, and the player needs to flip two cards each turn until all 16 cards have been matched. When two cards gets matched they stay with their face up, and if they don't they get flipped back.

A player can see how well he is doing by looking at the star rating and the number of moves that has been taken. The stars are calculated like this: ⭐⭐⭐ stars for under 15 moves, ⭐⭐ stars for under 20 and any higher will give ⭐ star. There is also a timer to show how long it took for the player to complete the game. They can also use the restart button at anytime to start over.

When all cards have been matched, a popup modal will appear, letting the player know the game has been won and show their final score. They also get the option of replaying the game.
