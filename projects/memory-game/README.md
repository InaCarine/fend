Link to the game: https://inacarine.github.io/fend/projects/memory-game/

This is one of the projects that was done in the Google Front-end developer Nanodegree scholarship.  
It should fulfill the requirements outlined in the https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view

The game and the timer starts when the player clicks a card, and when all cards have been matched the game has been won.  
The player's amount of tries to match a card is counted and a star rating is showed based on how many moves that have been done.  

There's also an option to restart the game at anytime

For the icons I have used [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  
I have also used https://autoprefixer.github.io/ to add the necessary vendor prefixes for the css
